## Grade Requirements ðŸ—‚

- Note taker app opens and user is presented with a link to notes page
- when user clicks link to notes page they are presented with a page that has existing notes on left hand column and empty fields to enter new note titles, they can then add text to the notes on right column 
- when user enters new note title and txt then a save icon appears in navigation at top of page
- when save icon is clicked, the new note is saved on left hand column with other notes 
- when user clicks on existing note from left, the notes appear in right hand column
- when user clicks "write" option in nav bar, they are presented with empty fields to input new note title and notes 



## Getting Started

On the back end, the application should include a `db.json` file that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the `fs` module.

The following HTML routes should be created:

* `GET /notes` should return the `notes.html` file.

* `GET *` should return the `index.html` file.

The following API routes should be created:

* `GET /api/notes` should read the `db.json` file and return all saved notes as JSON.

* `POST /api/notes` should receive a new note to save on the request body, add it to the `db.json` file, and then return the new note to the client. You'll need to find a way to give each note a unique id when it's saved (look into npm packages that could do this for you).


## Bonus

You havenâ€™t learned how to handle DELETE requests, but this application offers that functionality on the front end. As a bonus, try to add the DELETE route to the application using the following guideline:

* `DELETE /api/notes/:id` should receive a query parameter that contains the id of a note to delete. To delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the `db.json` file, remove the note with the given `id` property, and then rewrite the notes to the `db.json` file.




### Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%

* Satisfies all of the preceding acceptance criteria plus the following:

  * Application front end must connect to an Express.js back end.

  * Application back end must store notes that have a unique id in a JSON file.

  * Application must be deployed to Heroku.






### Bonus: +10 Points

* Application allows users to delete notes.
